# Weather Company Data API access for IBM Cloud

This project shows how to build a basic data access application that continuously runs in the background, processing a variety of weather data from the Weather Company Data for IBM Bluemix REST API endpoints, including severe weather alerts, tropical storm forecasts, and the daily weather almanac to find conditions over time.
